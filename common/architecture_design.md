# Designing Architecture

## 3 important points you must consider

* Readability
* Extendability
* Maintenanceability

### Readability

Code must be readable for other developers. It does not mean that you write many comments. Good code can be easy to understand without comments. Function names, Variable names should be descriptive.

### Extendability


### Maintenanceability


## Use most modern architecture pattern

## Use at least one technology/architecture pattern which is really new for you

You don't design architecture only with the technologies/architecture pattern you already used before. Every time you MUST try to use something new.
