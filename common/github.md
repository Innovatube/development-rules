# GitHub Repository Working Rules

## All your work must be associated with one issue on github

Your coding work must be associated with github issue. If you found a bug and it's not associated with any issue or associated with closed issue, you should create new issue. No exception.

## Write issues descriptive

You must write issue contents descriptively. Use screen shots. Add more 2 sentences after you finish writing your issue.

## All your commit must be associated with one issue on github

All commits are surely associated with only one issue. And you need to write issue number like `#123 Create DateTimeHelper to provide consistent handling for date time structure`.

## You MUST write descriptive message on git commit.

Never write meaningless message like "More fix" or "Bug Fix". You need to write "What did you do" clearly.
Examples:

* Added CLI Wrapper to native Evaluation Mode
* Remove some unnecessary items from gitignore
* Less globals pollution; adding debug-break option
